If you go diving in deep enough, you'll find executables somewhere :P (I'll add a link to the latest commited (but not necessarily stable) EXE soon :-) )

If you are going to compile (maybe run, idk) you will need to copy ScintillaNET.dll and Scilexer.dll into somewhere located in your Windows path variable.

If you have any ideas, email me - chris.ward@emailme.com.au

At the moment I won't be accepting pull requests nor adding contributors.
